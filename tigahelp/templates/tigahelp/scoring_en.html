    <h1>SCORE INFO</h1>
    Actions taken in Mosquito Alert have recognition and rewards in the form of points. The number of points per report varies depending on the information provided and its quality.

    <p>The maximum points that can be obtained per report are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Invasive <em>Aedes</em> Mosquito: 20 XP</li>
        <li>Common mosquito: 14 XP</li>
        <li>Storm drain breeding site: 20 XP</li>
        <li>Other breeding site in a public area: 16 XP</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are also extra bonuses for the first mosquito of the season, first report of the day or for participating frequently.</p>

    <p>Reports that are submitted as a mosquito but turn out not to be mosquitoes will not earn points. Likewise, a photo that does not allow experts to identify what appears in it will not be scored.</p>

    <p>The accumulation of points will allow you to go up a <b>level</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(1) Novice (novice)</li>
        <li>(2) Contributor (contributor)</li>
        <li>(3) Expert (expert)</li>
        <li>(4) Master (master)</li>
        <li>(5) Grandmaster (grandmaster)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Icons always indicate the level you are at.</p>
