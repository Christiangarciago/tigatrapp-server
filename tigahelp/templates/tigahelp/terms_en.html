        Mosquito Alert (hereinafter, “the Project”, in any of the names it has had in the past or may acquire in the future) is a citizen science project coordinated by the Centre for Advanced Studies of Blanes, part of the Spanish Research Council (CEAB-CSIC),and CREAF.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Project relies on members of the public to collect data on the spread of tiger mosquitoes and yellow fever mosquitoes. You can participate by, among other things, sending and sharing data and images through any of the Project applications for mobile devices or other electronic devices. To do so, you must be an adult or supervised by an adult and you must agree to the Project privacy policy as well as the following terms:
    </p>

        <li>
            The tiger and yellow fever mosquitoes can be vectors of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and zika. The Project contributes to the fight against these diseases by, among other things, collecting data and images, analyzing and studying this information, and collaborating with awareness-raising campaigns and in surveillance and control activities. Since the target species are disease vectors, you must exercise caution while participating in the Project and must not actively approach the mosquitoes directly or through their breeding sites. The Project website contains information on how to send data and pictures by first trapping the species to avoid being bitten. It is your responsibility not to get close to these species proactively.
        </li>

        <li>
            By sharing your data and works (e.g. pictures) with the Project, you agree on the present terms of use, agree that the works (e.g. pictures) may be released to the public as anonymous works without including your name or pseudonym, and grant the members of the Project a royalty-free, non-exclusive and sub-licensable license for the duration of the current applicable copyright laws to exploit the work without restrictions and transfer it to others worldwide.

        </li>

        <li>
            Generally, any original creation protectable by copyright will be disseminated by the Project with a CC-BY license, indicating anonymous author and the Project name (example: Anonymous, CC-BY Mosquito Alert), even if the creations contains the author’s name in it or in its metadata. When possible, part of the databases or resulting tables from user contributions will be disseminated, as a general rule, under a CC0 license. In the case of a need to allow access or transfer to third parties (professionals responsible for the monitoring and control of these mosquitoes, researchers, public health managers, etc.) of information collected by the Project and considered sensitive (and not disseminated under a CC0 license), other protocols and/or appropriate licenses will be established.
        </li>
