<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

The AtrapaelTigre project takes data shared by volunteers and it makes
this data available to third parties and the public. In order the protect the privacy of its volunteers,
the project aims to avoid collecting information from which any individual may be personally identified. It does not
collect names, addresses, passwords, or any other personal information from volunteers. It collects the
precise locations of
volunteers when they submit reports, but it links this information only to the report and to a randomly-generated
user ID. It also collects rough locations of volunteers throughout the day (in order to assess the areas that its
volunteers are monitoring for mosquitoes),
but these locations are again linked only to randomly-generated user IDs. Volunteers may include notes and
photographs in the reports they submit, but it is their responsibility not to include in these notes and photographs
any information that they wish to keep private or any information that violates the privacy rights of others or is
inconsistent with the AtrapaelTigre terms of use.

The full list of information collected is as follows:
<ul>
    <li>All of the reports volunteers submit on breeding sites, adult mosquito sightings,
        and tiger mosquito missions. This
        includes the volunteer's precise location when submitting each report, any location that the volunteer
        specifies on
        the report map, and any photographs,
        notes or other information that the volunteer attaches to the report.
    </li>

    <li>Rough information about volunteer locations at other times, sampled at random time intervals. This information
        is
        collected in order to build a map of the geographic areas that volunteers are monitoring for tiger mosquitoes,
        and to
        learn more about the routes along which tiger mosquitoes may be spreading. In order to make it impossible to determine precise location information from this data, the latitudes and longitudes are rounded down to the nearest 0.05 degrees before the location is transmitted from the volunteer's device. This makes it impossible to determine where the actual location was within a 0.05 degree latitude by 0.05 degree longitude area (the size of a small city like Blanes).
    </li>

    <li>Information about the phone model, battery power, language settings, and Tigatrapp installation (i.e. which
        version of Tigatrapp is installed and what operating system and operating system version it is installed on).
        This
        information
        is used to help the research team improve the application.
    </li>
</ul>
