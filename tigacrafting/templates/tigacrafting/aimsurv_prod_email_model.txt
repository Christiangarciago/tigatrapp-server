Dear {{ name }}

Thank you very much for agreeing to be a part of EntoLab. We have now concluded the testing phase and we will start working on real data from Thursday July 9th onwards.

You can use the same credentials that you used in the test version, which are included for your convenience here:

Login: {{ login }}
Password: {{ password }}

The EntoLab address has changed! From now on, please use this address to access the platform:

{{ production_link }}

Please take a look at the Mosquito Alert Terms of use documentation. Here you will find guidelines on how to manage, publish and share results from data obtained through EntoLab:

{{ document_autoria }}

Right now, Entolab will consume data from the original Android and IOS apps. This will change as soon as we can deploy the new app versions which will be available soon.
You will be receiving for validation mosquito reports from all the Euro zone except Spain: if you are a regional manager, all reports from your managed area will pass through you.
Any question you might have, please contact us through email at r.eritja@creaf.uab.cat and fbartu@ceab.csic.es. The EntoLab version that you will be using is not a test version anymore, so please use it responsibly!

Kind regards,
Mosquito Alert Team
